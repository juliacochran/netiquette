                <li>Chances are, if you're uploading media, you want people to see it.</li>
                <li>Original content (remixes count) make bigger splashes than complete copies.</li>
                <li>Give it your own spin.  Give people what they want.  Give them what they don't have.</li>

                <li>Media sites have an innate ability to create internet-wide trends.</li>
                <li>People follow channels for the content that they produce.  Changing this ecosystem can lead to loss of subscribers and leave people with a bad taste in their mouth.</li>
                <li>As a content curator, it's your responsibility to ensure the peace and harmony of your charge.  Create new profiles if you must or simply broaden your scope.</li>
                <li>As always, be careful how you use your profile if it can be tracked back to you.</li>
