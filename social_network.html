                <ul>
                    <li>Employers often use profile searches to weed out potential candidates.</li>
                    <li>Much of what you post to a social network is viewable via a quick Google search regardless of the privacy settings you have chosen.</li>
                    <li>You don't want the success of your job search to hinge on the quality of last Saturday's misadventures.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Comments usually aren't as easily accessible as other posting options on social networks, but that doesn't mean they aren't equally as important to your image.</li>
                    <li>While a post is shared with your entire network, comments are more often viewed by those you have close acquaintances with.</li>
                    <li>This smaller venue is much better suited for controversial topics that your entire network may not agree with.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A profile is an easy way to share the current state of your life with all of your friends, but proper precautions should be taken to help prevent personal information from falling into malicious hands.</li>
                    <li>Save more personal, easily abused information for those friends whose personal information is equally valuable to you.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Choosing to connect solely with people you are good friends with helps cut down on the uninteresting clutter that is sure to accumulate in your News Feed or LinkedIn and helps to secure your information from that weird guy you met in third grade.</li>
                    <li>Don’t tempt yourself into making poor decisions on social networks because of the activities of your acquaintances.</li>
