                <li>Don't believe everything you read.</li>
                <li>Reporters are only human and errare est humanum (to error is human)</li>
                <li>Do as much research about the outlet as you do about the story.</li>
                <li>News outlets are companies like any other and have an innate interest in the bottom line.</li>
                <li>Many outlets are owned by larger entities with their own socio-economic agendas.</li>

                <li>News sources, no matter their reputation, are fallible.  Research your topic to ensure your voice is an informed one.</li>
                <li>A small factual flaw in your argument may lead to your dismissal altogether.  Better safe than sorry.</li>
                <li>A calm voice is more likely to be taken seriously in a serious news forum.  Explain your position rather than defame the other.</li>
                <li>Don't get frustrated and never lose hope.  Just like any other online forum, there are sure to be trolls and devil's advocates present.  Present your argument and rest easy knowing you have numerous other avenues to effect change in the world.</li>

                <li>As Professor Oak once said, "There's a time and place for everything."  Ensure you're utilizing the correct forum when sharing news topics.</li>
                <li>Your network is filled with students of a great myriad of beliefs.  Be aware of the risks of sharing controversial topics with your entire network.</li>
                <li>Every article/source has its own built-in biases.  Leave it up to the individual to establish their own position before provoking a heated discussion.  This allows for the complete exploration of a subject matter, based on the Socratic method, rather than simple mud slinging.</li>
