                    <li>Spamming is useless. Forums are community-driven and no community likes spam.</li>

                    <li>Comments on forums are often crude and offensive. This is fine, they are built to handle, and even facilitate, such bouts of rage. If you feel the need to speak your mind in such a manner, make sure it serves to better the community, i.e. not something that serves the platonic ideal of trolling.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Accounts on forums are almost always more useful when they are unattached to you personally. This allows you to speak about controversial topics without fear of retribution, whether physically or mentally.</li>
                    <li>Make sure no personally-identifiable information is on your profile, unless you specifically want that profile to be your official handle of representation.</li>
                    <li>Create as many profiles as you need to. Profiles work better when they each have a sense of self. This allows each alias to build their own reputation and can lead to deeper discussions that only come about through familiarity.</li>
