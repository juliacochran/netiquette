                Employers often use profile searches to weed out potential candidates. Much of what you post to social networking sites is viewable via a quick Google search regardless of the privacy settings you have chosen. You don't want the success of your job search to hinge on the quality of last Saturday's misadventures.

                Comments aren't as easily accessible as other posting options on social networks, but that doesn't mean they aren't equally as important to your image. While a post is shared with your entire network, comments are more often viewed by those you have close acquaintances with. Your mom might be delighted to see you comment about a political position while others may rise to anger. This smaller venue is much better suited for controversial topics that your entire network may not agree with.

                A social networking profile is an easy way to share the current state of your life with all of your friends. Facebook is still an online medium, however, and proper precautions should be taken to help prevent personal information from falling into malicious hands. Information such as hometown, birthday, and email address might be interesting to your friends on a routine, casual Facebook stalk, but information such as your current address, phone number, and year of birth might be tools in the arsenal of an actual stalker. Save more personal, easily abused information for those friends whose personal information is equally valuable to you.
