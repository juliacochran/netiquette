                    <li>Employers often use profile searches to weed out potential candidates.</li>
                    <li>Much of what you post to a social network is viewable via a quick Google search regardless of the privacy settings you have chosen.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Comments usually aren't as easily accessible as other posting options on social networks, but that doesn't mean they aren't equally as important to your image.</li>
                    <li>While a post is shared with your entire network, comments are more often viewed by those you have close acquaintances with.</li>
                    <li>This smaller venue is much better suited for controversial topics that your entire network may not agree with.</li>

                    <li>A profile is an easy way to share the current state of your life with all of your friends, but proper precautions should be taken to help prevent personal information from falling into malicious hands.</li>
                    <li>Save more personal, easily abused information for those friends whose personal information is equally valuable to you.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Choosing to connect solely with people you are good friends with helps cut down on the uninteresting clutter that is sure to accumulate in your News Feed or LinkedIn and helps to secure your information from that weird guy you met in third grade.</li>
                    <li>Don’t tempt yourself into making poor decisions on social networks because of the activities of your acquaintances.</li>

                    <li>Think twice before you post and make it relevant!</li>
                    <li>Post what you know: If you post a photo of something interesting, explain why you think it's interesting. Others may agree, or not. And that kind of discussion leads to more followers and more people repinning / reblogging your posts.</li>
                    <li>Reblogging / repinning is lazy and addicting, but make sure that you're not always linking to existing content. I'm sure you have something unique to offer.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cater to the community - post items relevant to the community. If your topic has a narrow audience, navigate to a related sub community and share it there.</li>
                    <li>Spamming is useless. Forums are community-driven and no community likes spam.</li>

                <ul>

                    <li>Comments on forums are often crude and offensive. This is fine, they are built to handle, and even facilitate, such bouts of rage. If you feel the need to speak your mind in such a manner, make sure it serves to better the community, i.e. not something that serves the platonic ideal of trolling.</li>

            <div class = "tip_content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Accounts on forums are almost always more useful when they are unattached to you personally. This allows you to speak about controversial topics without fear of retribution, whether physically or mentally.</li>
                    <li>Make sure no personally-identifiable information is on your profile, unless you specifically want that profile to be your official handle of representation.</li>
                    <li>Create as many profiles as you need to. Profiles work better when they each have a sense of self. This allows each alias to build their own reputation and can lead to deeper discussions that only come about through familiarity.</li>

              <li>Your network is filled with students of a great myriad of beliefs.  Be aware of the risks of sharing controversial topics with your entire network.</li>
              <li>Every article/source has its own built-in biases.  Leave it up to the individual to establish their own position before provoking a heated discussion.  This allows for the complete exploration of a subject matter, based on the Socratic method, rather than simple mud slinging.</li>
