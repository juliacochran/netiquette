                    <li>Overposting or overpinning won't gain you any more fans. Your existing followers may get weary of seeing your posts all over their home page daily and stop following you.</li>
                    <li>Think twice before you post and make it relevant!</li>
                    <li>Post what you know: If you post a photo of something interesting, explain why you think it's interesting. Others may agree, or not. And that kind of discussion leads to more followers and more people repinning / reblogging your posts.</li>
                    <li>Reblogging / repinning is lazy and addicting, but make sure that you're not always linking to existing content. I'm sure you have something unique to offer.</li>

                    <li>This is the first interaction many people will ever have with you. Make a good impression.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that your comment isn't going to offend a large group of people.</li>
                    <li>Constructive criticism is always welcome.</li>
                    <li>Raging / hate is okay only sometimes. Make sure you're in the right community for it before you hit 'Post.'</li>
